# SID_RNG
- This program will read in excisting subject ID's (SID) for an existing project document and generate a new randomly generated unique SID, 
  based on the SID's that are already currently in use for a particular project. 


# Instructions 
- Download the R code and example excell file. 
- Open the R script in R Studio and change the Pathway to wherever you downloaded the example Excel file.
- Execute the program and it will produce a unique SID, between 1000-9999, that does not match the SID's currently in the document. 
- Adding new SID's to the excell document will prevent them from being generated by the script.
